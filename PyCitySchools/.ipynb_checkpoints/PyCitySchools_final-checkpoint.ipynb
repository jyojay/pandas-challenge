    "It was seen that the LGA had an average maths score of 70.34, reading score of 69.98, maths passing students percent of 86.08 and reading passing students percent of 84.43 with an overall passing percent of students of 72.81 - Ref. table 1) from above.\n",

    "1) Smaller schools (by number of students upto 2000) had higher pass percent than \n",
    "larger schools - Ref. table 8) from above.\n",

    "2) Overall pass percent was higher for Independent schools. Pass percent in Maths was also considerably higher in Independent schools - Ref. table 9) from above.\n",

    "3) Percent of students passing in Maths was higher than in reading - Ref. table 2) from above.\n",

    "4) Percent of students passing in schools with spending range 585-630 dollars was the highest - Ref. table 7) from above.\n",

    "5) Maths score by year was very consistent for each school - Ref. table 5) from above.\n",
